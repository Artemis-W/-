    Mermelada's mother Fraise, told her she was to meet up with an old friend of hers, called Leona
in Vherak'an, where they were to decide on the next destination of their journey, she has arranged 
with the sailor's guild for a travel pass for wherever she would like to go. Unbeknownst to them, she 
has also arranged safe passage with the king of pirates, so the ship designated to the princess was to 
be left alone in the voyage.
    When they reach the ship they are told by Captain Torag, an upbeat ex-pirate, who became close 
friends with Leona through a missadventure in the pirate seas north of Naugladur. He tells them he needs
another day before departing for either Naugladur, Evaemon or the Ignean Empire, but that they don't 
recommend going to the Ignean Empire given the current state of affairs.
