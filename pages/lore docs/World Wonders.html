            <h2 id="place">Yggdrassil</h2>
            Found within the great kingdom of ___, Yggdrasil, the World Tree, serves as both home to many peoples, and sometimes a gateway into the feywild.
            A bustling metropolis surrounds it, with people living within it's bark and it's branches, or under the cover of it's roots. Fertile soil covers
            the land for miles surrounding it, which has helped expand the city and feed the kingdom. But beneath it's roots something curious lies. A passageway
            surveiled by soldiers because of the dangers beyond. If you follow it you will find yourself in a strange underground land.

            <h2 id="place">Great Reef</h2>
            Found along the coast to the south of the Ignean Empire, and within the Underwater Republic of ____ this wondrous place is the subject of many a pilgrimage 
            from diverse corners of the world, known both by it's beauty, and the presence of skillful aquatic healers, whose powers are boosted by the latent magic of 
            the reef. Also notable is the relation it holds to Evanescet isle, as it can often be seen moving near the edges of the reef only to suddenly dissappear within 
            the hour. Also within the reef, underwater settlements are commonplace, living off the algae and animals that are abundant in the area.

            <h2 id="place">Dorgheshuun Volcano</h2>
            A magestic centerpiece of the Kingdom of Dorgheshan, where the forges of Grahkar and the springs of Khealth lie, places where the most skilled of orcish
            artisans and healers work. Many travel to see the magnificent river Vhrilo, which shines in rainbow colours as it passes over the glowing cristaline sediment
            that was formed by the mystical fires of the volcano. Dormant for almost a millenia, the volcano is thought to have been frozen by Nerissa, where pyra was put
            laid to heal after a great battle that left her scarred.

            <img class="place_2" src="../../images/places/World Wonders/Mystical Falls.jpg">
            <h2 id="place">Mystical Falls</h2>
            Hidden within the jungles of Kraidsun the Mystical falls are the origin point to three rivers, those being Necro, Iluno and Vento, which are the main source of water
            for all the creatures that inhabit the rainforest. The falls are surrounded by floating islands, levitated by crystals of great power, from which water pours down.
            These cristals can't be found anywhere else, but also do not seem artificial in nature, but rather the result of divine action in the past.

            <h2 id="place">Mount Karuulm</h2>
            Standing as the tallest peak on the realm and covered in bright vegetation all the way to the top, this place is magical only in subtle ways. Despite the fact that
            air should not be present at this height, creatures can breathe normally when around the Cherry trees that grow at Mount Karuulm, and so many a settlement has formed
            in this unlikely place, taking advantage of the region's topography to defend themselves from external threats. <!--Despite being found in between two massive countries
            the independant cities that surround the peak stand strong, boasting a large populace of winged creatures, capable of roaming the place much more easily and defending
            it as well.-->
