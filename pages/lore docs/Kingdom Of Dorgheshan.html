        <h1 class="page-intro">&emsp;Kingdom of Dorgheshan</h1>
        <h1 class="article-intro">Recent History of the Kingdom</h1>
        <article>
            &emsp;The current rulers of Dorgheshan are descendants of a noble orcish family that looked for peace in 
            times of war, and thus got exiled by the warmongering rulers at the time. In exile they made many
            allies among the other countries, and their wealth and connections enabled them to influence the 
            political climate of the states from the outside. This culminated after an especially sour defeat 
            of the orcish armies at the hands of a dragon that invaded from the deserwch left the rulers of 
            the states weak, and the Fragaria family was able to return to provide aid, and, after gathering 
            their followers, the Heiress to the Fragaria family, Frukta, along with her mother Achene, staged
            a widespread coup across all the states, which came to pass without battle, in which they captured
            and imprisoned all the rulers, and replaced them with powerful allies from the states they derived
             ~who had sworn fealty under a magical agreement called the 7 provinces accord~ 
            thus maintaining the hierarchies but securing themselves as rulers of the unified kingdom. This led 
            to the era of peace the kingdom is currently experiencing.
            <br>
            &emsp;A golden age followed, which continues to this day under the rule of her daughter, Fraise, which has seen the devolopment of many cities, temples,
            mines, and the recently founded school of magic, which boasts fascinating arcane architecture. It takes the shape of a castle, but you are always just one
            door away from your destination. This is partly because of Fraise's best friend's fascination with the arcane, being an experienced magical user,
            which combined with her knowledge of architecture, led her to build the place she would have liked to study when she was a child.

        <h1 class="article-intro">The State of the Kingdom</h1>
        <article>
            &emsp;Despite the continued economic growth the country has mantained throughout the rule of Queen Frukta,
            and later Queen Fraise, her daughter, many orcs descendants from the warmongering noble families
            and their servants, still hold a grudge towards those who stood to gain from the coup, and hold the 
            royal family under heightened scrutiny. One wrong move from the Fragaria family, and much progress 
            could be lost as regards a peaceful Dorgheshan moving forward.
        </article>
        <h1 class="article-intro">The capital city of Dharok'an</h1>
        <article>
            &emsp;Dharok'an is the modern centerpiece to the Kingdom of Dorgheshan. Purpose-built by the Fragaria
            family during the rule of the Queen Frukta to be the location of the new government and castle.
            Finished before the end of her rule, Frukta moved many strings to make sure the new capital city
            succeeded in taking hold, hiring the most prestigious architects from around the world to aid in
            it's construction.
            <br>
            &emsp;Nowadays, the city is one of the safest in the world, due in no small part to the exelent commanders
            the Fragaria family selected and trained. Currently, Vraxa and Axandra hold the most power in the city
            as Captain of the peacekeepers and the royal guard respectively. They are the daughters of Frukta's 
            right hand woman Alexa Battleaxe, who lead the military aspect of the coup and ensured it's success.
            Vraxa and Axandra were trained by her personally, to serve Fraise dutifully, and they have not let
            her down.
