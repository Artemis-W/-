        <h1 class="page-intro">&emsp;Kingdom of Evaemon</h1>
        <h1 class="article-intro">Recent History of the Kingdom</h1>
        <article>
            &emsp;The history of Evaemon is extensive, and very varied, having long periods of piece and 
        societal and economic growth, followed by periods of opression responded with violent uprisings 
        and civil wars. The majority race in this territory is that of elves, and despite their lengthy
        lifespans, many are prone to prejudice against what technological and cultural development
        brings to their "pristine" lives.<br>
            &emsp;In "recent" times, the prior royal family served as figureheads for the spread of new ideas
        in the kingdom, having risen to power centuries ago by staging a coup against a group of nobles
        who had seized the throne to put a stop to the modernization of the elven capital, Evaemon.
        The family was mainly comprised of studious technomancers, architects, lawyers and merchants
        who had put forwards many city-planning strategies that are used worldwide nowadays, in order
        to improve the city. Their popularity had skyrocketed after Elisya, the youngest of the family,
        slew an elder wyrm with a magitech device so powerful, it was rumoured to have the strength
        to blow the very moon out of the sky.<br>
            &emsp;The device itself was destroyed in battle with the dragon, and Elisya was hailed as a hero
        throughout the country. When the noble families of old heard of the news, they sought to claim
        this power for themselves, and to do so, forcefully seized the throne and took Elisya's Family
        hostage to bargain for the weapon.<br>
            &emsp;What they didn't know was that there was someone on the inside giving information to her,
        and when the trade was set to be made, the nobles were captured with a new device, and banished to
        Shadowfell to pay for their crimes.<br>
            &emsp;After this, with the former royal family gone, and no trace found of the rival nobles, Elisya
        took the throne and brought forth a prosperous era of peace and technological development, only 
        interrupted by quickly neutralized outside forces.<br>
            &emsp;However, when she passed, the heir to the throne misteriously banished, along with all the 
        magitech relics his mother had developed. This brought upon a succession war among the remaining
        family members, who, weakened by the in-fighting, couldn't prepare for the attack of a litch, who
        was searching for the relics. The litch slew the royal family and banished, tho little is known
        about his whereabouts.<br>
        |   &emsp;The remaining royals, fled to the countryside under pseudonyms and were never again heard of, 
        and in their absence, the barrier that prevented the banished elves from returning weakened, and 
        they were able to return from shadowfell and reclaim the throne, puppeteering one of the larger
        noble families to remain unperturbed. 
        </article>
        <h1 class="article-intro">The Royal Family</h1>
        <article>
            &emsp;The supposed royal family, the Anths, despite holding the throne, have lost all power for the
        very unpopular decisions made by their overlords to restrict the development of new technologies,
        increase tax rates, and close several trade routes, in an attempt to deprive the country of power
        and come into governance through a staged coup, where they make themselves out to be saviours
        restoring order to the country.<br>
            &emsp;The Faranth family, leaders of the banished nobles are lead by the so-called queen Valindra
        who has sent out spies throughout the lands, and assasins to weaken the political structures of
        the rest of the countries.<br>
            &emsp;To do so, they have brought from their time in the Shadowfell a new kind of construct capable
        of rational thought but incapable of empathy, that banishes upon death. These constructs, called
        Darkhensylvs are made by binding to the corpses of deceased creatures dark energy from wells on
        the other side.
        </article>
        <h1 class="article-intro">The State of the Kingdom</h1>
        <article>
            &emsp;Many once powerful families of Elves have been greatly weakened by the schemes of the Faranths,
        and are beggining to manifest their discontent in subtle ways. Many are resorting to fraud to be 
        be able to keep themselves afloat, and a network of noble families has formed who share information
        on the movements of the Anth family. Unbeknownst to them, they are being manipulated by the Faranths,
        who have inserted spies into the network, and are fanning the flames of rebellion.<br>
            &emsp;The common folk have not seen much change in the century since the passing of the last queen
        but are beggining to feel the effects of the schemes due to the changing of trade routes, and 
        heightened taxes from the lords of their regions.
